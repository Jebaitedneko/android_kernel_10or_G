	---help---
	  This is a complete low memory killer solution for Android that is
	  small and simple. Processes are killed according to the priorities
	  that Android gives them, so that the least important processes are
	  always killed first. Processes are killed until memory deficits are
	  satisfied, as observed from kswapd struggling to free up pages. Simple
	  LMK stops killing processes when kswapd finally goes back to sleep.

config ANDROID_SIMPLE_LMK_MINFREE
	int "Minimum MiB of memory to free per reclaim"
	range 8 512
	default 128
	help
	  Simple LMK will try to free at least this much memory per reclaim.

config ANDROID_SIMPLE_LMK_TIMEOUT_MSEC
	int "Reclaim timeout in milliseconds"
	range 50 1000
	default 200
	help
	  Simple LMK tries to wait until all of the victims it kills have their
	  memory freed; however, sometimes victims can take a while to die,
	  which can block Simple LMK from killing more processes in time when
	  needed. After the specified timeout elapses, Simple LMK will stop
	  waiting and make itself available to kill more processes.
